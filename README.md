## Features

### Core Viewer
- **Viewer Only** — no editing, no plugins, no vaults
- **Formats** — opens `.md`, `.markdown`, and `.mdown`
- **GitHub-style rendering** — clean typography, code blocks, tables, task lists
- **Dark mode** — full system dark/light mode support
- **Local assets** — resolves local images relative to the document
- **Auto reload** — instantly updates when the file changes externally

### Workspace
- **File sidebar** — open any folder as a workspace (`⇧⌘O`), browse the Markdown file tree
- **Collapsible folders** — tree defaults collapsed; expand manually, state is preserved
- **Table of Contents** — outline sidebar with clickable headings (`⌘T`)
- **Scroll memory** — remembers your scroll position per file

### Search
- **Quick Open** (`⌘P`) — command palette to find any Markdown file by name or path
  - Type a filename to search by name
  - Type a `/` to search by relative path (e.g. `docs/setup`)
  - Keyboard navigation: `↑ ↓` move, `↵` open, `esc` close
- **Find in Document** (`⌘F`) — search text inside the currently open rendered document
  - `⌘G` / `⇧⌘G` to jump between matches
  - `esc` closes the find bar and clears highlights

### Design
- Warm neutral macOS palette — not a web app wrapped in a window
- Responsive Quick Open palette scales to window and fullscreen size
- Reading Mode — strips all sidebars for focused reading
- Zero telemetry, zero analytics, zero network requests
